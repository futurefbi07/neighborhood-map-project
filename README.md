## Introduction

This is the final project for the [Udacity Front End Development Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships). The task was to first build a single page application featuring a map, and the add functionality to the map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## How to Run the APP

Make sure Node.js is installed
Clone this repo to a directory of your choosing using git clone
Using the terminal: cd into the directory
Using the terminal: `npm install` and once that is finished `npm start`
The page should automatically load in browser via http://localhost:3000.
But, App will not display until you edit the App.js file and enter your Client ID, Client Secret, and API Key where indicated.
